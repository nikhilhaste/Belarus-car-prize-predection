# About the project
The Belarus Car Price Prediction project is a data-driven initiative designed to forecast car prices in Belarus. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 56,244 rows and 12 columns, the project explores various factors such as car brand, year, engine specifications, and more to understand their impact on car pricing. Through in-depth exploratory data analysis, significant insights have emerged, including the notable increase in car prices post-2000, the pricing disparities between fuel types and transmission modes, and the premium attached to electric and all-wheel-drive vehicles. Leveraging a decision tree regressor model, the project achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 85.29%, with the year of production and engine volume identified as pivotal features in predicting car prices. This project serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders in the Belarusian automotive market, offering insights that inform pricing strategies and consumer decisions.
